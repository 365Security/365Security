Hi Team!
This repository has been set up as a temporary sharing environment for basic scripts and workflows for Microsoft 365.

There is no data about any organisations that are associated with the purpose of these scripts, so please feel free to use in other projects :)

**DEFENDER GPOs**

This GPO will provide the minimum required GPO settings for Defender to run on workstations and servers within your environment. This will be crucial in ensuring that you have an EDR backup in place during the transition to the new EDR platform.
